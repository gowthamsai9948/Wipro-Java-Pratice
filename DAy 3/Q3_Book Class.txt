// Book Class
Create a Java class named Book to represent a book. The class should have the following features:

Instance Variables:

title (String): to store the title of the book.

author (String): to store the name of the author.

year (int): to store the publication year of the book.



Constructors:

A default constructor that initializes the title, author, and year to default values ("Not specified", "Unknown", and 0, respectively).

A parameterized constructor that takes values for title, author, and year and initializes the corresponding instance variables.



Methods: A method named displayInfo that prints the details of the book (title, author, and year).



Application: In the main method, create two instances of the Book class using both the default constructor and the parameterized constructor.

Call the displayInfo method on each instance to display the details of the books. Your goal is to implement the Book class with appropriate constructors and methods as described.

Sample Output:

Book 1:
Title: Not specified
Author: Unknown
Year: 0


Book 2:
Title: "Java Programming"
Author: "Sakshi"
Year: 2024

Your answer  //

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Book {
    String title;
    String author;
    int year;

    // Default Constructor
    Book() {
        title = "Not specified";
        author = "Unknown";
        year = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Book(String title, String author, int year) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display book info
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Title: " + title);
        System.out.println("Author: " + author);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
        System.out.println();
    }

    // main() method inside Book class â€” program starts here
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book book1 = new Book();  // Calls default constructor
        Book book2 = new Book("Java Programming", "Sakshi", 2024);  // Calls parameterized constructor

        System.out.println("Book 1:");
        book1.displayInfo();

        System.out.println("Book 2:");
        book2.displayInfo();
    }
}
